        <p>many products claim they are "privacy-friendly."
        <p>but, what does that mean for a product to be privacy-friendly?</p>
        <p>have those products defined "privacy-friendly"?</p>
        <br/>
        <p>here is a suggestion of criterion:</p>
        <br/>
        <p>1) the code should be open-source. Why shall people trust teams/products who don't trust to open source their code?</p> 
        <br/>
        <p>2) there should be no trackers. Stop tracking people. People are not the product; whether people pay for the product is irrelevant. People should not be subject to tracking. Can product teams trust their vision to lead product development with no tracking?</p>
        <br/>
        <p>3) venture-capital-backed product - who knows which companies will end up acquiring those products/startups? where will people's data end up?</p>
        <br/>
        <p>4) is the infrastructure of those products centralised or decentralised? do those products process and/or store people's data on their servers?</p>
        <br/>
